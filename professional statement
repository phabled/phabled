I consider myself to have strong communication and time management skills, and I absolutely intend to refine these as I progress throughout my career.

I value protecting people, having strong ethics and the adhering the laws.


I am a highly motivated and competitive cybersecurity analyst. I make certain I find potential risks, threats and vulnerabilities by communicating with my team and using my time efficiently so I am able to protect people's information. I enjoy working with technology and learning as much as I can.
