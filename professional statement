I consider myself to have strong communication and time management skills, and I absolutely intend to refine these as I progress throughout my career.

I value protecting people, having strong ethics and the adhering the laws.


I am a highly motivated and competitive cybersecurity analyst. I make certain I find potential risks, threats and vulnerabilities by communicating with my team and using my time efficiently. Defending against attacks using carefully crafted and strong security frameworks is important to me so I can protect the people and organizations I need to.
